The module pattern is used to provide public and private encapsulation in classes. The module pattern in JavaScript is used to emulate the concept of a class from other OO languages.

Using the module pattern, we are able to include public and private variables as well as methods inside a single object. This can be used to shield members from the global scope and provide privacy. 

Since access modifiers are not available in JavaScript, true privacy cannot be achieved but we can use function scope to simulate it. Anything defined within the module pattern is only available inside the module pattern unless defined under the returning object, which is available publically. 

The example code uses the revealing module pattern, where all the members are declared in the "private" scope and then an anonymous object with pointers to the private members we wish to be revealed is returned. 

```javascript
var todoModule = (function() {
                // private variables
                var pList = [];

                // public variables
                var pModuleName = 'My Module';

                // private methods
                function getId() { }

                // public methods
                function addTodoItem(title) { }
                
                function removeTodoItem(title) { }

                function getAllTodoItems() { }

                return {
                    moduleName: pModuleName,
                    add: addTodoItem,
                    remove: removeTodoItem,
                    getAllItems: getAllTodoItems
                };
            })();
```
